this project is about how cameras read and count people who see advertisements with several criteria including:
1. people look straight at a screen or camera
2. people will be recognized so they cannot count the same person

faces.py is the basis of this program
faces-train.py is python for creating basic fingers and saving in the form of faces arrays
trainer.yml is a file that contains an array of raw image data that is used as a reference
ujicoba x.py is a trial program for appropriate feature placement. is currently exploring ujicoba 2.py
